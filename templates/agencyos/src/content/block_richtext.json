    "content": "<p>Hi {{ contact.first_name }},</p>\n<p>Thanks for meeting with me the other day. It was nice to have the time to dig in and have a more focused conversation. I have outlined three options of increasing complexity for the project. The options are incremental, meaning that each includes and builds upon the previous options. This will allow you to pick a level that suits the urgency and budget.</p>\n<p>Please note that this is not an estimate, it is a quote. The price you agree to is exactly how much you&rsquo;ll pay. If I have underestimated how long it will take me to do the work, that&rsquo;s my problem, not yours.</p>\n<p>Because of this, I&rsquo;m strict about what&rsquo;s included and what&rsquo;s not. Please do not assume anything. If there is anything you want included that you don&rsquo;t see explicitly listed, we&rsquo;ll need to talk about it and I&rsquo;ll send a revised quote. When you get a chance, please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments. I&rsquo;ll touch base with you on DATE THAT IS THREE TO FOUR BUSINESS DAYS IN THE FUTURE if I haven&rsquo;t heard back by then.</p>\n<p>- Bryant Gillespie</p>"

    "headline": "How We Can Do This",
    "content": "<h3>A) Quick and Cheap</h3>\n<p>This would be the bare minimum to get a working integration between the two.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll use existing tools like <a href=\"http://Zapier.com\">Zapier.com</a> or <a href=\"http://Make.com\">Make.com</a> as the backbone for this integration. We&rsquo;ll also have to write a bunch of custom JavaScript to make sure everything maps correctly. But it can be completed fairly quickly and cheaper than building a full blown separate app.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fairly quick to standup</li>\n<li>Easier on budget</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dependencies on third party tools / subscriptions</li>\n<li>Can&rsquo;t guarantee it scales well</li>\n<li>Troubleshooting / error handling done through third party tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Timeline and Deliverables</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Item</th>\n<th>Estimated Time</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Planning</td>\n<td>2 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pressero Webhooks Setup (through Zapier / Make)</td>\n<td>2 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom Scripting and Zap / Scenario creation</td>\n<td>3 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Creating Flow for Mapping New Pressero Stores to shopVOX Customers</td>\n<td>2 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Testing</td>\n<td>3 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Launch / Troubleshooting</td>\n<td>3 days</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong></p>\n<p>$8,700 one time</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll fix any bugs or issues for 30 days after the launch included in this price.</p>\n<p>~$0-25 per month in hosting</p>\n<p>~$1,500 in support and maintenance per year if things break</p>\n<h3>B) The Proper Way</h3>\n<p>The proper way to build this would be a separate app that runs on it&rsquo;s own server with redundancies built in case a sync fails and no third party dependencies (except shopVOX and Pressero). We&rsquo;d build this using PHP and MySQL as the database.</p>\n<p>The app would have it&rsquo;s own dashboard where you can see all the sync history / status / errors and map everything correctly in shopVOX.</p>\n<p>We can host it for you or help you set it up on your own hosting / servers.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guaranteed to scale well and run securely with minimal headache</li>\n<li>Easy to update if either vendor changes API details in future</li>\n<li>Easy to use dashboard interface to control mapping / error handling / activity</li>\n<li>Could be potentially turned into SaaS app and sold to others using Pressero &lt;&gt; shopVOX</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drawback</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bigger budget may not be worth it unless you plan to use Pressero for a long time</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Timeline and Deliverables</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Item</th>\n<th>Estimated Time</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Planning</td>\n<td>2 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>shopVOX API Bridge</td>\n<td>5 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pressero API Bridge</td>\n<td>5 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pressero Webhooks Setup</td>\n<td>2 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pressero to shopVOX Mapping</td>\n<td>5 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>shopVOX IDs Store</td>\n<td>5 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mapping / Error - Dashboard UI</td>\n<td>10 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Testing</td>\n<td>3 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Launch / Troubleshooting</td>\n<td>3 days</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong></p>\n<p>$22,600 one time</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll fix any bugs or issues for 60 days after the launch included in this price.</p>\n<p>~Minimal costs for support and troubleshooting (unless adding new features)</p>\n<p>~$25-$50 per month in hosting</p>\n<h3><strong>C) Alternative to Pressero</strong></h3>\n<p>It looks like most of what you&rsquo;re selling inside Pressero currently is apparel items. We&rsquo;ve been quietly developing a web store platform for apparel decorators over the last year. It&rsquo;s called <a href=\"https://storeflow.app\">StoreFlow</a>.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re currently halfway through beta testing. But part of our plans for the round of development is building a shopVOX integration to push orders into shopVOX from StoreFlow.</p>\n<p>The only piece that we don&rsquo;t currently have that I think you&rsquo;d probably benefit from within Pressero is their order approval flow. Are you planning on using it?</p>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong></p>\n<p>$-900 ðŸ˜†</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll give you $900 in credit that you paid for the exploratory work towards a StoreFlow subscription ($199 / month right now).</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m more than happy to give you a full demo of the app if you&rsquo;d like.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Rabbits are a great source of environmental benefit. They help to keep grasslands and other ecosystems in check. Rabbits are herbivores, meaning they eat only plants, which helps to keep vegetation in balance. Additionally, rabbits are crucial to the food chain, providing sustenance for predators in their environment.</p>\n<p>Rabbits also help to improve the quality of soil by digging burrows and depositing their waste in them. This helps to aerate the soil, improving its quality and allowing for better plant growth. Additionally, the waste from rabbits is a rich source of nutrients for plants and other animals in the area. This helps to keep the soil healthy and support the overall ecosystem.</p>"
