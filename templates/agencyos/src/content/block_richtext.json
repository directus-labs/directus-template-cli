Rabbits are herbivores, meaning they eat only plants, which helps to keep vegetation in balance. Additionally, rabbits are crucial to the food chain, providing sustenance for predators in their environment.</p>\n<p>Rabbits also help to improve the quality of soil by digging burrows and depositing their waste in them. This helps to aerate the soil, improving its quality and allowing for better plant growth. Additionally, the waste from rabbits is a rich source of nutrients for plants and other animals in the area. This helps to keep the soil healthy and support the overall ecosystem.</p>",
